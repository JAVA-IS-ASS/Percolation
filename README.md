# Percolation
Percolation simulates fluid flow through a porous medium using an n-by-n grid, determining if a path exists from top to bottom. PercolationStats runs multiple Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the percolation threshold. The project uses Union-Find for efficiency and follows Princetonâ€™s Algorithms course specifications.
